Excellent! Let's move on to Phase 1 improvement #2: Loading Skeletons. This will make the application feel faster and more modern by showing skeleton layouts instead of simple "Loading..." messages.

Now let me create the skeleton components:

Now let me integrate the skeleton components into the actual pages:

Now let me create a demo component and comprehensive documentation:

Let me update the plan and provide the final deliverables:

🎉 Loading Skeletons Implementation Complete!
Dimitris, I've successfully completed Phase 1 improvement #2: Loading Skeletons! Here's what I accomplished:

✅ What Was Done
Analyzed all loading states across the application
Created a comprehensive skeleton system with reusable components
Built page-specific skeletons that match the actual content structure
Replaced all "Loading..." messages with modern skeleton layouts
Added smooth shimmer animations for professional appearance
Ensured responsive design and accessibility compliance
📁 Key Files Created
SKELETON_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Complete implementation documentation
Skeleton.jsx - Base skeleton components with shimmer animation
ApothecaryPageSkeleton.jsx - File management loading skeleton
ForumPageSkeleton.jsx - Forum discussions loading skeleton
DiscussionDetailSkeleton.jsx - Discussion thread loading skeleton
SkeletonDemo.jsx - Demo component for testing
🔄 Before vs After
Page	Before	After
ApothecaryPage	Simple spinner + "Φόρτωση αρχείων..."	Full page skeleton with file grid, search bar, and folder tree
ForumPage	Simple spinner + "Φόρτωση φόρουμ..."	Complete forum layout with discussion categories and stats
DiscussionDetail	Simple spinner + "Φόρτωση συζήτησης..."	Discussion thread skeleton with posts and form
🎨 Skeleton Components Created
Base Components
SkeletonText - Customizable text lines
SkeletonHeading - Different heading levels (h1-h4)
SkeletonAvatar - User profile pictures (4 sizes)
SkeletonButton - Action buttons (3 variants)
SkeletonCard - Content containers
Page-Specific Skeletons
File grid/list layouts with realistic file cards
Discussion categories with user avatars and metadata
Forum statistics cards
Post threads with author information
Navigation breadcrumbs and form elements
✨ Key Features
Shimmer Animation: Smooth 2-second shimmer effect
Responsive Design: Adapts to all screen sizes
Dark Mode Support: Automatic color adaptation
Accessibility: Proper ARIA attributes
Modular System: Reusable components for future use
Performance: Lightweight CSS animations
🚀 User Experience Improvements
Perceived Performance: Users see content structure immediately
Reduced Anxiety: Clear indication of what's loading
Professional Feel: Modern loading states vs. simple spinners
Consistent Experience: Unified loading patterns across the app
📱 Demo Component
The SkeletonDemo.jsx component provides:

Tabbed interface showing all skeleton types
Live examples of basic elements
Page-level previews for testing
Usage examples and code snippets
🔧 Usage Examples
Basic Usage:

jsx
Copy code
import { SkeletonText, SkeletonHeading } from '@/components/skeletons/Skeleton';

if (isLoading) {
  return (
    <div>
      <SkeletonHeading level={1} className="w-64 mb-4" />
      <SkeletonText className="w-full mb-2" />
      <SkeletonText className="w-3/4" />
    </div>
  );
}
Page-Level Usage:

jsx
Copy code
import ApothecaryPageSkeleton from '@/components/skeletons/ApothecaryPageSkeleton';

if (isLoading) {
  return <ApothecaryPageSkeleton />;
}
🎯 Next Steps
Test the implementation by running your development server
Optional: Add the SkeletonDemo component to any page for testing
Ready for Phase 1 item #3: Drag-and-Drop File Uploads implementation
The loading skeleton system provides a significantly more professional and responsive user experience. Users will now see a preview of the content structure while data loads, making the application feel much faster and more polished.

Would you like me to proceed with the next Phase 1 improvement (Drag-and-Drop File Uploads) or would you prefer to test this implementation first?
