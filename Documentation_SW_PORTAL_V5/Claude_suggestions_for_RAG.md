**Link:** https://docs.unstructured.io/examplecode/notebooks  
**Key Insight:** Provides complete examples of processing PDFs and adding document source references to RAG responses.

**Resource Type:** Tutorial  
**Resource Name:** Flask Official Celery Documentation  
**Link:** https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/celery/  
**Key Insight:** Shows how to use Celery for background tasks that run while requests return immediately, perfect for file processing.

**Resource Type:** Blog Post  
**Resource Name:** Asynchronous Tasks with Flask and Celery  
**Link:** https://testdriven.io/blog/flask-and-celery/  
**Key Insight:** Demonstrates how to develop a Flask application that works with Celery to handle long-running processes triggered by POST requests.

**Resource Name:** Recent Flask + Celery Tutorial  
**Link:** https://flask-india.hashnode.dev/using-background-tasks-with-celery-in-flask  
**Key Insight:** Very recent tutorial (1 week old) on integrating Celery with Flask for asynchronous background tasks.

## 2. Vector Database Integration with Flask

**Resource Type:** Tutorial  
**Resource Name:** Real Python ChromaDB Guide  
**Link:** https://realpython.com/chromadb-vector-database/  
**Key Insight:** Provides hands-on experience with ChromaDB integration and practical examples for NLP applications.

**Resource Type:** Tutorial  
**Resource Name:** DataCamp ChromaDB Step-by-Step Guide  
**Link:** https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/chromadb-tutorial-step-by-step-guide  
**Key Insight:** Covers how to add and remove documents from ChromaDB, essential for dynamic updating of your vector database.

**Resource Type:** Documentation  
**Resource Name:** LangChain Chroma Integration  
**Link:** https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma/  
**Key Insight:** Official documentation showing how to get started with Chroma vector store in LangChain.

**Resource Type:** Documentation  
**Resource Name:** LangChain FAISS Integration  
**Link:** https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss/  
**Key Insight:** Explains how to use Facebook's FAISS library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

## 3. RAG Orchestration Frameworks

**Resource Type:** Documentation  
**Resource Name:** LangChain Unstructured Loader  
**Link:** https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_file/  
**Key Insight:** Shows how to use Unstructured document loader within LangChain to load multiple file types.

**Resource Type:** Documentation  
**Resource Name:** LangChain PDF Loader with Unstructured  
**Link:** https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_pdfloader/  
**Key Insight:** Demonstrates how to keep document elements separate or combine them, crucial for maintaining source attribution in RAG.

**Resource Type:** Tutorial  
**Resource Name:** Hugging Face Semantic Cache RAG  
**Link:** https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/semantic_cache_chroma_vector_database  
**Key Insight:** Shows a complete RAG solution using open-source models and Chroma DB with semantic caching for improved performance.

## 4. Frontend: Streaming & Source Citing

**Resource Type:** Tutorial  
**Resource Name:** OpenAI PDF Parsing for RAG  
**Link:** https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/parse_pdf_docs_for_rag  
**Key Insight:** Demonstrates how to turn rich PDF documents into usable content for RAG systems with proper formatting.

For streaming responses and source citing in React, you'll need to implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket connections between your Flask backend and React frontend. The document source references can be included in the response metadata from your RAG system.

**Additional Key Comparison:**
**Resource Type:** Blog Post  
**Resource Name:** FAISS vs Chroma Performance Comparison  
**Link:** https://medium.com/@stepkurniawan/comparing-faiss-with-chroma-vector-stores-0953e1e619eb  
**Key Insight:** FAISS is faster for initialization and has higher precision/recall scores, while Chroma offers easier integration for development.

These resources should give you a solid foundation for building your dynamic RAG system. Start with the Unstructured.io library for document processing, set up Celery for background tasks, choose between ChromaDB or FAISS based on your performance needs, and use LangChain to orchestrate the entire RAG pipeline.
